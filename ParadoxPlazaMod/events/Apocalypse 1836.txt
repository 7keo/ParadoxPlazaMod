Likewise, the new Standard Infantry Rifle (SIR) has been developed as a more accurate and semi-automatic alternative to traditional muskets and rifles. On a unit-level, soldiers were taught to fire with mechanical precision and alternate with a partner: one soldier shoots while the other reloads. Effectively, the advent of repeating rifles and new military tactics have led us to ultimate victory against the zombie hordes."
